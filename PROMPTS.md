1. Plan Mode (Opus 4.5 Max):
    Based on our project context @docs/context, create a plan for us to implement a working mvp

    Initially, let's set up the people search with our google programmable serach. 

    and then, we will test with an amazon rekognition integration.

    let's use the mono repo approach as suggested here. 

    At this moment, ui should not be our priority, just the initial flow of the images search -> rekognition validation -> scoring
2. before that, verify your code with these contexts @aws rekognition docs
